- [July 11, 2025, 10:01 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/07/114834962216483220/): Coulda sworn the Mastodon web UI already used to be here on the left side a long time ago then it moved to the right and now apparently they have decided left was already correct
- [July 10, 2025, 8:49 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/07/114829019922253678/): @Xjs you dont have to do all these things on the go! I just log stuff in a notes app then reconcile everything once a day
- [July 9, 2025, 6:56 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/07/114822913539087816/): #Superman was very good
- [June 25, 2025, 11:35 p.m. PopQuiz x Eastwood City Food Park: Feast of Flavor Trivia Night](https://roytang.net/2025/06/popquiz-feast-of-flavor/): We attended PopQuiz x Eastwood City Food Park: Feast of Flavor Trivia Night! Unfortunately, we did not do well, finishing 3rd out of 4th teams. This was mostly a function of the first place team having a successful ace/gamble while we failed ours; if the fortunes had been reversed, we would have won! So in that sense, it was kind of a close fight. The event came with vouchers for food and drink, but the drink was coffee which was a bad idea and gave me trouble sleeping that night! Round breakdown: Food in Pop Culture: 8pts Famous Chefs: 8pts

- [March 24, 2024, 2:36 p.m. Popquiz: The Errors Tour](https://roytang.net/2024/03/popquiz-errors/): First popquiz for the year! This quiz was not entirely Taylor Swift-themed though that was a strong component. Alas, our Ace went poorly and with it our chance of winning the event. We ended up finishing 3rd out of 5 teams which wasn&#x27;t too bad (still got a prize!) Rounds were: Fearless Women in Pop Culture - 7? points, x0 because of failed Ace Cottagecore in Pop Culture - 4pts Paint the Town Red - 8pts Epic Fails and Faux Pas - 5pts References of Time - 5pts The Year 1989 - 8pts x2 for joker (Hail Mary): Name the
- [March 20, 2024, 8:39 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2024/03/112128055412962771/): I love RSS, but one thing I don&#x27;t like is that readers typically homogenize the appearance of posts from different sources, which is fine that&#x27;s how aggregators work. But I miss seeing the flair of individual websites so I often find myself clicking thru entries to see their site designs. I kind of want a stylesheet element in the RSS feeds and feed readers could have a toggle where you can view each feed&#x27;s entries with their custom styles.

- [March 11, 2024, 11:35 p.m. Disney/Pixar Movie Quiz Night @ Cinema 76](https://roytang.net/2024/03/cinema76-disney/): We attended a Disney/Pixar movie themed quiz night at a new venue (new for us), Cinema 76 Cafe. The venue was a combination of cafe + a small theatre were they screened a couple of movies a day. While this quiz still followed the usual whiteboard answer format as our other quiz nights, it was a bit more strict. Spelling/punctuation had to be accurate, and we had to put our phones into a white box they gave us while the rounds were ongoing! There were 4 regular rounds and 2 bonus rounds with I think 15 questions each. Round 1:

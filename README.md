- [Oct. 12, 2023, 11:28 p.m. Popquiz Magic Mystics](https://roytang.net/2023/10/popquiz-magic-mystics/): We hadn&#x27;t attended PopQuiz in a couple of months, but the categories for this one looked good so went for it. Attendance was low though, only 3 teams! Wizarding World / Harry Potter - 4pts Magic the Gathering - 9pts (x2 for joker. Hard carry!) Lord of the Rings - 8pts (x2 for successful ace) Game of Thrones - 6pts Discworld - 6pts (went surprisingly well considering I had only read 1/4 of the books Dungeons and Dragons - 6pts I was worried after round 1 because both of the opposing teams used their jokers and did well while it

- [Oct. 11, 2023, 11:14 p.m. Geekfight: Noisy / Standing](https://roytang.net/2023/10/geekfight-noisy-standing/): This was game 3 of the current Geekfight League, themed as &quot;back to school&quot;. (The trivia team sent representatives to game 2 which was Taylor Swift themed, but I did not attend as I had nothing to contribute. The team won that one though!) Geography - 3pts (not unexpected) Languages - 6pts Math - 7pts (x2 for joker) MAPEH - 4pts Science - 5pts History - 2pts (also unsurprising!) I was worried we wouldn&#x27;t make it, but it turned out to be another low-scoring game and we tied for first! That means we retain our position as league leader!

Latest notes:

- [June 15, 2025, 2:38 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/06/114686003160672507/): The downside of always finding new #blogs to read/follow is that keeping up with the feed reader becomes challenging. I am still reading weeknotes from like April!
- [June 15, 2025, 1:02 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/06/114682791242906156/): I think I read something like if when you try some new thing and then you&#x27;re not immediately good at it and you find that annoying/disappointing/discouraging, that this is a sign of #ADHD or #Neurodivergence or something like that. How true is this?
- [June 13, 2025, 8:03 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/06/114675956063565364/): Will stream some more #FinalFantasy drafts on #MagicArena in a few minutes. Hopefully I do better than last time! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg
- [June 13, 2025, 6:13 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/06/114675521562119248/): @dominik i am curious to hear some examples
- [June 11, 2025, 8:11 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/06/114664661427076638/): gonna stream a #finalfantasy draft on #MagicArena #mtg https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy

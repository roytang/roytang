- [Oct. 25, 2024, 6:52 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2024/10/ltnw9os/): If I use a border for a card and I only have 1 of it then I change my mind later, can I move/use that same border on a different card instead?
- [Oct. 24, 2024, 7:52 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2024/10/lthxptw/): What was the URL of your blog? FYI, the URL to check for archived websites is The Wayback Machine at https://web.archive.org/, but the internet archive is currently under attack so the services may be down intermittently. You can try again after a few days. If you leave the URL here, someone else (maybe me) can check when the wayback machine is up and reply to you to confirm that the site is available on the wayback machine.

- [Oct. 8, 2024, 11:48 p.m. TriviaDown: Video Games quiz night](https://roytang.net/2024/10/triviadown-videogames/): Trivia team attended a quiz night hosted by Trivia Down @ Skyline Sports Bar in Century City Mall in Makati. Last May attended one of their quizzes with a different group. This was the trivia team&#x27;s first foray with this host since before the pandemic. I usually dislike going all the way out to Makati, but we liked the theme for this one (videogames) and I was telling the group that pre-pandemic we used to go out to Makati quiz nights all the time, so maybe this was also a bit of an attempt to capture some of that energy.

FYI, your footnote links ([1], [2] and such) don&#x27;t work (the browser doesnt scroll to the appropriate footnote - no matching anchors). The backlinks from the footnotes do work though. (Replying via mastodon, but the comment is meant for the website of course)

- [Dec. 12, 2023, 7:24 a.m. Twitch Recap](https://roytang.net/2023/12/twitch-recap/): My twitch activity this year has been roughly the same (or a bit lower) compared to last year.
- [Dec. 12, 2023, 6:21 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/12/111564113332035538/): @jefklak you mean by using the keyboard arrow keys, yeah? The prev/next nav doesn&#x27;t have that kind of keyboard support, even with the previous implementation, since it currently doesn&#x27;t use any JS. You can still tab to the buttons and Enter, but I understand that&#x27;s clunky. I was thinking of adding some progressive JS enhancement to support swipe left/right nav, so I could add the left/right arrow key support as well, but I&#x27;m not sure when I&#x27;ll get around to that. Thanks for the feedback!
- [Dec. 10, 2023, 2:06 p.m. Reddit Recap 2023](https://roytang.net/2023/12/reddit-recap/): Reddit Recap continues to be a thing. I think this years stats are more or less the same as last year&#x27;s, except I spent 40% less time scrolling through reddit this year. Previously: 2022, 2021

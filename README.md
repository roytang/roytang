- [Jan. 26, 2026, 3:12 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2026/01/115960157168763909/): With #windows&#x27; recent patch problems (https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/windows-11-second-emergency-out-of-band-update-kb5078127-released-address-outlook-bugs), it feels like I was incredibly lucky with my timing in switching to Linux lol. MS has never been known as a bastion of software quality, but even this nonsense is unexpected given Satya now claims 30% of their code is written by #genAI!

- [Jan. 16, 2026, 11:24 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2026/01/nzxn6yl/): It is considered an artifact whether or not the ability is activated. If the ability is not activated it cannot be targetted by spells that target creatues and it cannot be destroyed by effects like &quot;destroy all creatures&quot; because it is not a creature. If you activate the ability it becomes both an artifact and a creature and can be affected by spells that affect creatures.

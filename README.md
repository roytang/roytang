- [Oct. 16, 2023, 1:06 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/10/111242954765318385/): Wilds of Eldraine quick drafts came back to Arena last week, so I decided to do a couple of them to end the season. Since there was a season reset I was at silver and winning is a lot easier at the lower ranks. First QD (WB) went 7-1 while the second QD (BGr) went 7-2. Overall I think this puts WOE as my winningest limited format on Arena to date! It&#x27;s a good place to stop and start saving up for the next set! #mtg #mtgwoe #magicarena (Click photos to view full-size)

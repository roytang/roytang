- [May 24, 2025, 11 p.m. Pisay B2K Quiz Night @ Gacha](https://roytang.net/2025/05/pisay-b2k-quiz/): I attended B2K: Battle 2 Know Quiz Night @ GACHA. This was a fundraising event by PSHS batch 2000. The usual trivia team opted against attending this (the entrance fee was expensive!) but my PSHS batchmates wanted to join, so I went along with them. The place was packed, and mostly with PSHS alumni (not surprising). The round by round breakdown: science and math: 8pts brand logos: 4pts sports GOATs: 7pts hollywood hits: 8pts national flags: 2pts pinoy tv: 0pts PH provincial capital cities: 7pts song lyrics: 6pts The first few rounds weren&#x27;t too difficult, and we even did surprisingly
- [May 19, 2025, 10:34 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/05/114534992684875010/): Went ahead and finished the main story of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 tonight before doing any side stuff. Such a fantastic well-done game; outstanding ambience, graphics, combat, music, story, everything! Possibly now my new favorite JRPG[^1] of all time. #gaming #ClairObscurExpedition33 [^1]: Not actually from Japan Lune looking to the horizon A tragic choice Ending screen saying &quot;THANK YOU&quot; The gang looking at a clear sky

- [May 15, 2025, 11:48 p.m. Popquiz Trivia Night: Good Game](https://roytang.net/2025/05/popquiz-games/): Attendance: Me, Liz, Chi, Jaime, Cole, Macho We attended a games-themed PopQuiz at a new venue this Thursday. The venue was Quantum Neon mini-golf at Home Depot Ortigas. They have a sister restaurant calle Xin Xin. Rounds were: Sports Goats - 7pts Video Game Bosses - 5pts x2 for powerup Boardgame Meeples - 9pts Sports in Pop Culture - 4pts Video Game Music - 9pts x2 for ace. This was a fun round. We missed the Breath of the Wild main theme because honestly that seems kinda forgettable. Boardgame Rules - 9pts (Hail Mary) Hollywood actors in video games -

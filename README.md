- [June 22, 2025, 12:11 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/06/114725060446015158/): For no particular reason today I remember that in the first Civilization game: if you were playing a democracy and tried to start a war, the senate would veto that decision.
- [June 22, 2025, 7:21 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/06/114723921039291977/): Normally I appreciate people enjoying my RSS feeds, but if you&#x27;re going to be hitting my feed url every minute (I DO NOT POST THAT MUCH!!), at least use a proper user agent jeez Screenshot of server logs showing the /blog/feed/rss/ url being hit regularly every minute with the same user agent pretending to be a browser
- [June 21, 2025, 3:21 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/06/114720145676296010/): My server&#x27;s getting really hammered this week, IDK what I&#x27;ve done this time to earn the gaze of the LLM scraper bots
- [June 15, 2025, 11:28 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/06/114688086144301277/): Until the end of 2024, I had a bot running trivia questions over on bots.inspace. Since that instance shut down, I haven&#x27;t had time to migrate the bot elsewhere, and I&#x27;m looking to do that now. Any recommendations for a server/instance I can use? The bot isn&#x27;t high volume - basically 2 automated posts every hour. #bot #bots #trivia
- [June 15, 2025, 2:38 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/06/114686003160672507/): The downside of always finding new #blogs to read/follow is that keeping up with the feed reader becomes challenging. I am still reading weeknotes from like April!

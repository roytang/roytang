- [Jan. 1, 2026, 12:10 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/12/115815049029565777/): Happy new year fediverse! - from utc+8
- [Dec. 31, 2025, 3:02 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/12/nwvkern/): You were correct that the attack does nothing after being blocked despite exiling the blocker. Removing a blocker doesnt send the damage through unless your creature has trample. Also, don&#x27;t rely on ChatGPT for anything; lol that answer is blatantly incorrect.
- [Dec. 26, 2025, 8:42 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/12/115783090672801756/): I&#x27;m still waiting for sleepyskunk&#x27;s 2025 movie trailer mashup @_@
- [Dec. 25, 2025, 2:22 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/12/115778762850367509/): Merry Christmas Fediverse!
- [Dec. 24, 2025, 10:43 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/12/115775073328955221/): After playing #EternalCardGame for something like 8.5 years, I finally completed all the Steam Achievements! (There are a few more achievements in-game, but honestly that might take another decade or so lol) Screenshot of the Steam header for Eternal Card Game, showing 176/176 achievements and over 1400 (!!) hours played Screenshot of Eternal Card Game achievement list, showing the most recent ones I finished

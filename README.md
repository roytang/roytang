- [Feb. 22, 2024, 12:53 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2024/02/111973342274002940/): Mastodon should also provide a filter to ignore mentions from newly created accounts (twitter had sth like this) and maybe even mentions where N or more people are tagged
- [Feb. 22, 2024, 3:43 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2024/02/111971178513928495/): @Sibshops yeah that&#x27;s what i assumed should happen, so IDK why Tusky is still showing me these
- [Feb. 22, 2024, 3:36 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2024/02/111971151235763302/): Do filters not work in Tusky? I added some filters to help with the latest version of the spam wave and the messages dont appear on the web version but are still shown in tusky&#x27;s notifications #tuskyapp #tusky [10:46] The spam notifs showed in metatext on ipados as well, so its not just a tusky thing apparently
- [Feb. 18, 2024, 12:36 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2024/02/111950627425751034/): Finally got hit by the spam wave people are talking about now I dont feel left out
- [Feb. 8, 2024, 11:17 p.m. Geekfight Hobby Stadium](https://roytang.net/2024/02/geekfight-hobby-stadium/): We attended Geekfight @ Hobby Stadium. Unfortunately, attendance was pretty low on this one, possibly due to the pre-long weekend traffic; the only other teams were a team of 2 and a team of 1, so it felt a bit like we were bullying them lol. We won this one. Hobby Stadium - 4pts (ROUND LEADER) MTG - 5pts x2 for joker (ROUND LEADER) WWE - 2pts Basketball - 4pts (ROUND LEADER) Pokemon - 1pts (tied for ROUND LEADER) Disney - 6pts (tied for ROUND LEADER) In addition to the usual winner prize, they gave away themed prizes for teams

- [June 27, 2024, 11:51 p.m. Popquiz: Rainbow Party](https://roytang.net/2024/06/popquiz-rainbow/): We attended Pop Quiz again at Int/Ext, this time with the Rainbow theme for Pride Month. They were away for a couple of months because the host had a health scare, but apparently we are back in business. Attendance: Me, C, S, Kim, Dan. This quiz night&#x27;s rounds were rainbow-themed, with one color per round (skipping Indigo). They&#x27;re mostly general knowledge questions except each themed around a color, so choosing a power-up round was a crapshoot. Here&#x27;s how we did: Red - 7pts Orange - 9pts x2 for successful ace. We got the ace answer at the very last question,
- [June 19, 2024, 11:24 p.m. Smartypants Quiz Night @ Tiny Bar](https://roytang.net/2024/06/smartypants-tinybar/): We attended a Sitcoms-themed quiz night under a new host, Smarty Pants PH at Tiny Bar, Panay avenue. The other teams apparently weren&#x27;t used to quiz nights, so we kind of felt like bullies and there was a lot of good-natured trash-talking towards us. We won, but the final scores had the second place not as far away as everyone thought. Categories breakdown: General sitcom trivia: 12pts Sitcom theme music: 16pts Pinoy Sitcoms: 5pts Chandler&#x27;s punchlines: 10pts Sitcom sets: 10pts They had a quiz format where they actually prepared 8 categories but we only played 5. After the quiz, the

The mall looks much better than I remember, it kind of had a glow-up from like St Francis Square level to Robinson&#x27;s Galleria level.
- [June 12, 2024, 10:46 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2024/06/112604190894862607/): #TIL that PH independence day falls on the same day as Russia day, i.e. the anniversary of the founding of the Russian federation
- [June 6, 2024, 11:43 p.m. Don Conejos Quiz Night #3](https://roytang.net/2024/06/don-conejos-03/): We attended our third quiz night at Don Conejos. It was a rainy evening, and Jason was a bit late this time. This night&#x27;s categories and our scores were: &quot;Back to school&quot; -&gt; Fictional schools: 10pts &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; -&gt; Human anatomy: 10pts &quot;Fowl territory&quot; -&gt; Chickens: 6pts &quot;Elementary&quot; -&gt; Sherlock Holmes: 9pts (x2 for joker) &quot;Mugging for the Camera&quot; -&gt; Celebrity Mug Shots (visual): 6pts &quot;How Things Work&quot; -&gt; Technology: 5pts &quot;He&#x27;s got it all&quot; -&gt; Brad Pitt: 8pts &quot;How Deep Is Your Love&quot; -&gt; Songs with &quot;Love&quot; in the title (audio): 14pts We did extremely well!

This one was themed around occupations that were often used as sexy halloween costumes. We had no expectations for this one; I just missed going out for quiz nights honestly. Rounds were: Teachers and Librarians - 8pts Construction Workers/Engineers - 5pts Priests and Nuns - 2pts Doctors and Nurses - 9pts Police/Military - 6pts (x2 for joker) Maids/Butlers and Servers - 5pts (Hail Mary) Identify the punny costumes - 3pts (Tie breaker: Did not affect us) Village

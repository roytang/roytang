I haven&#x27;t read the book it was based on, although I read that it was a loose adaptation. Good use of camera work to portray the more &quot;supernatural&quot; elements of the case. Decent performances, though I often have trouble taking Tina Fey seriously. I kind of suspected the final culprit but couldn&#x27;t explain why, though in hindsight the case might have been solveable, had one

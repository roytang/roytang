- [June 25, 2025, 11:35 p.m. PopQuiz x Eastwood City Food Park: Feast of Flavor Trivia Night](https://roytang.net/2025/06/popquiz-feast-of-flavor/): We attended PopQuiz x Eastwood City Food Park: Feast of Flavor Trivia Night! Unfortunately, we did not do well, finishing 3rd out of 4th teams. This was mostly a function of the first place team having a successful ace/gamble while we failed ours; if the fortunes had been reversed, we would have won! So in that sense, it was kind of a close fight. The event came with vouchers for food and drink, but the drink was coffee which was a bad idea and gave me trouble sleeping that night! Round breakdown: Food in Pop Culture: 8pts Famous Chefs: 8pts
- [June 21, 2025, 3:21 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/06/114720145676296010/): My server&#x27;s getting really hammered this week, IDK what I&#x27;ve done this time to earn the gaze of the LLM scraper bots
- [June 15, 2025, 2:38 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/06/114686003160672507/): The downside of always finding new #blogs to read/follow is that keeping up with the feed reader becomes challenging. I am still reading weeknotes from like April!

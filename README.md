- [May 19, 2025, 10:34 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/05/114534992684875010/): Went ahead and finished the main story of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 tonight before doing any side stuff. Such a fantastic well-done game; outstanding ambience, graphics, combat, music, story, everything! Possibly now my new favorite JRPG[^1] of all time. #gaming #ClairObscurExpedition33 [^1]: Not actually from Japan Lune looking to the horizon A tragic choice Ending screen saying &quot;THANK YOU&quot; The gang looking at a clear sky
- [May 18, 2025, 6:48 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/05/114525608715626976/): Took me forever to get my SECOND Blue Prince trophy. I am not sure how some of these are even possible! #gaming Blue Prince trophy list on PC Game Pass
- [May 15, 2025, 11:48 p.m. Popquiz Trivia Night: Good Game](https://roytang.net/2025/05/popquiz-games/): Attendance: Me, Liz, Chi, Jaime, Cole, Macho We attended a games-themed PopQuiz at a new venue this Thursday. The venue was Quantum Neon mini-golf at Home Depot Ortigas. They have a sister restaurant calle Xin Xin. Rounds were: Sports Goats - 7pts Video Game Bosses - 5pts x2 for powerup Boardgame Meeples - 9pts Sports in Pop Culture - 4pts Video Game Music - 9pts x2 for ace. This was a fun round. We missed the Breath of the Wild main theme because honestly that seems kinda forgettable. Boardgame Rules - 9pts (Hail Mary) Hollywood actors in video games -
- [May 15, 2025, 1:18 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/05/114507324383988787/): Andor + Rogue One are just head and shoulders above any other piece of fiction in #StarWars. It&#x27;s just amazing how they managed to weave it all together while respecting the continuity of the films and even Rebels. I just found out that Tony Gilroy (Andor showrunner and R1 cowriter) was also the screenwriter for the original Bourne trilogy, which explains how good the infiltration and escape sequences in Andor are. I kind of want him to do something for the MCU! #tv

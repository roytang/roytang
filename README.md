I had low expectations for this one because sports! Only four teams attended. Rounds were: Boxing - 6pts Soccer - 6pts Basketball - 8pts Winter Sports - 5pts Olympics - 5pts Fictional Sports - 4pts (x2 for joker) (Hail Mary: Did not participate) ???

This meant the quiz ran much

A bit last minute, but I wanted to get out of the house to do something enjoyable after an exhausting past few days, so I asked the team to go. This night&#x27;s categories and our scores were (I was unable to note all the misleading category names): movies with numbers in title - 10pts anatomy - 6pts &quot;The China Crisis&quot; -&gt; china - 9pts voice actors - 7pts &quot;Real Steel&quot; -&gt; superman - 5pts: even though I&#x27;m a comics guy, this round was a

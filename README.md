- [March 12, 2025, midnight ](https://roytang.net/2025/03/114144629750867086/): Lol I managed to hit the final rank of sanctum mode in #MarvelSnap a mere hours before the mode goes away. Truly an accursed grind this format, I am glad to be rid of it
- [Feb. 24, 2025, 11:26 p.m. AboutQuiz All About Love: A Quiz Night About Love Languages](https://roytang.net/2025/02/aboutquiz-love/): We attended an AboutQuiz quiz night at Saludo&#x27;s! This is only their second quiz night after a post-pandemic comeback (we missed the first one). The theme for this one was about love languages. Event Page R1: Literature - 6pts R2: Geography (Before and After) - 5pts (x2 worst joker) R3: Brands - 8pts R4: Sex in Media - 7pts R5: Service - 7pts R6: Love - 5pts Pabibo: Elephants Medley - 2pts We were in clear first place before the Pabibo round, so we only wagered enough to ensure we won, and we barely got there! Luckily the other teams

Latest notes:

- [April 23, 2024, 9:35 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2024/04/l0trlzu/): but in paper it&#x27;s a real event where you get to meet and talk to people even if you go 0-3 This isn&#x27;t necessarily a positive for some people lol
- [April 22, 2024, 10:44 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2024/04/l0qxz40/): Resurrection of Magneto is not relevant to the main Fall of X story or any other titles until &gt;!Invincible Iron Man #17!&lt;, so you can just delay reading it until right before that issue.
- [April 21, 2024, 10:18 a.m. Popquiz: Comedy Special](https://roytang.net/2024/04/popquiz-comedy/): I think this is our first time back at the Vault for the year? The quiz wasn&#x27;t as hard as I thought it would be, but we screwed up the Ace, using it on the one round where we missed the Ace question. If we had used it on any other round we would have won, but instead we ended up tied for third place (we won the tiebreak, which was to name people who had hosted the Oscars more than once!) Rounds were: TV comedies - 7pts Sketch/improv comedy - 9pts Funny movies - 10pts (x2 for powerup) Memes
- [April 18, 2024, 3:10 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2024/04/112290970255509124/): Managed to hit infinite in #MarvelSnap for the 3rd time as a f2p player!
- [April 11, 2024, 11:28 p.m. Jason Quiz Night @ Don Conejos](https://roytang.net/2024/04/don-conejos-jason-quiz/): Jason, who used to host quiz nights at Amici Greenhills invited us to a quiz night at a new place: Don Conejos near Greenhills. The event was scheduled for 8pm and we were there on time, but it started late, almost 9:30pm I think. =/ We had a special guest from Sixsikan with us lol Jason&#x27;s quizzes always have &quot;misleading category names&quot; so you&#x27;re never sure what to use your joker on. This night&#x27;s categories were: &quot;Don&#x27;t You Forget About Me&quot; -&gt; Musician real names - 6pts &quot;Noong Unang Panahon&quot; -&gt; History - 8pts &quot;Play Ball&quot; -&gt; Sports - 2pts

- [April 21, 2024, 10:18 a.m. Popquiz: Comedy Special](https://roytang.net/2024/04/popquiz-comedy/): I think this is our first time back at the Vault for the year? The quiz wasn&#x27;t as hard as I thought it would be, but we screwed up the Ace, using it on the one round where we missed the Ace question. If we had used it on any other round we would have won, but instead we ended up tied for third place (we won the tiebreak, which was to name people who had hosted the Oscars more than once!) Rounds were: TV comedies - 7pts Sketch/improv comedy - 9pts Funny movies - 10pts (x2 for powerup) Memes

- [April 11, 2024, 11:28 p.m. Jason Quiz Night @ Don Conejos](https://roytang.net/2024/04/don-conejos-jason-quiz/): Jason, who used to host quiz nights at Amici Greenhills invited us to a quiz night at a new place: Don Conejos near Greenhills. The event was scheduled for 8pm and we were there on time, but it started late, almost 9:30pm I think. =/ We had a special guest from Sixsikan with us lol Jason&#x27;s quizzes always have &quot;misleading category names&quot; so you&#x27;re never sure what to use your joker on. This night&#x27;s categories were: &quot;Don&#x27;t You Forget About Me&quot; -&gt; Musician real names - 6pts &quot;Noong Unang Panahon&quot; -&gt; History - 8pts &quot;Play Ball&quot; -&gt; Sports - 2pts

- [March 24, 2024, 2:36 p.m. Popquiz: The Errors Tour](https://roytang.net/2024/03/popquiz-errors/): First popquiz for the year! This quiz was not entirely Taylor Swift-themed though that was a strong component. Alas, our Ace went poorly and with it our chance of winning the event. We ended up finishing 3rd out of 5 teams which wasn&#x27;t too bad (still got a prize!) Rounds were: Fearless Women in Pop Culture - 7? points, x0 because of failed Ace Cottagecore in Pop Culture - 4pts Paint the Town Red - 8pts Epic Fails and Faux Pas - 5pts References of Time - 5pts The Year 1989 - 8pts x2 for joker (Hail Mary): Name the

- [Nov. 16, 2023, 11:09 p.m. Popquiz Friendsgiving](https://roytang.net/2023/11/popquiz-friendsgiving/): We played a Friendsgiving-themed PopQuiz. BFFs in TV - 8pts (x2 for Ace) Buddies and #Squads in Movies - 5pts FRIENDS (TV show) - 8pts (x2 for Power Up) Thanksgiving in Pop Culture - 5pts Video and Board Games - 7pts Friendship Songs - 10pts One of my teammates was a big FRIENDS fan so we used our Power-Up there. The Ace also worked out for us. We didn&#x27;t qualify for the extra Hail Mary bonus round, but we didn&#x27;t end up needing it - we won the game comfortably! I was even able to answer a football question! Final
- [Nov. 9, 2023, 11 p.m. Popquiz: Marvels](https://roytang.net/2023/11/popquiz-marvels/): We played a Marvels-themed PopQuiz with only 4 players and 5 teams. Powers and Abilities in the Marvel Universe - 8pts (x2 for power up) Objects and Things in the Marvel Universe - 8pts Good Guys of the Marvel Universe - 7pts Locations and Events in the Marvel Universe - 8pts Villains of the Marvel universe - 8pts The &quot;Marvels&quot; - 8pts I came into this one super confident that I could basically solo it and got annoyed that I missed the very first question due to a brain fart. I ended up needing crucial help as well from one
- [Nov. 8, 2023, 11:42 p.m. GeekFight: Geeker X Fighter](https://roytang.net/2023/11/geekfight-league-5/): This was game 5 of the current Geekfight League, themed as &quot;anime/manga&quot;. We pulled in one of our friends who watches more anime than us, but we still did poorly. Video Games - 5pts Seinen and Josei - 3pts Studios and Publishers - 4pts Adaptations - 2pts Shōnen and Shōjo - 4pts (x2 for Joker) OPs and EDs - 3pts We retained our league lead, but are now within striking distance of one of the other teams. The next league game is themed &quot;Sariling Atin&quot; on the 22nd. Event Page
- [Nov. 8, 2023, 12:58 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/11/111370326820183406/): @www.jvt.me dont have time to test it or anything, but something like this would probably work: select repo, sum(case when advisory_type=&quot;SECURITY&quot; then total_advisories else 0 end) as total_security, sum(case when advisory_type=&quot;DEPRECATED&quot; then total_advisories else 0 end) as total_deprecated, sum(case when advisory_type=&quot;UNMAINTAINED&quot; then total_advisories else 0 end) as total_unmaintained from ( your original big query ) group by repo
- [Nov. 4, 2023, 4:01 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/11/111351226290526313/): Is there a way I can figure out the exact time a specific Mastodon server received a particular message/toot/mention from another server? (I have an account on the receiving server)

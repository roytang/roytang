- [July 14, 2024, 2:41 p.m. Don Conejos Quiz Night #4](https://roytang.net/2024/07/don-conejos-04/): Last Wednesday, quiz host Jason said he was hosting at Don Conejos again the next day. A bit last minute, but I wanted to get out of the house to do something enjoyable after an exhausting past few days, so I asked the team to go. This night&#x27;s categories and our scores were (I was unable to note all the misleading category names): movies with numbers in title - 10pts anatomy - 6pts &quot;The China Crisis&quot; -&gt; china - 9pts voice actors - 7pts &quot;Real Steel&quot; -&gt; superman - 5pts: even though I&#x27;m a comics guy, this round was a

- [July 7, 2024, 10:05 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2024/07/1dxhaua/): Posted on r/comicbooks: Iron Fist question Hi, I&#x27;m reading through Iron Fist stuff. In Iron Fist #73 (Oct 2017), Danny has Shou-Lao in a hidden dragon den in his condo building, feeding him cows. I don&#x27;t know how/why Shou-Lao got there?!? The last thing I remember is that at the end of Iron Fist: The Living Weapon #12 (May 2015), Pei brought back all 66 previous versions of Shou-Lao, and Luke and Danny say they&#x27;ll handle it, but I don&#x27;t think them handling the dragons was ever shown anywhere either?!? Pei&#x27;s story continues in Immortal Iron Fists #1, but there&#x27;s
- [June 27, 2024, 11:51 p.m. Popquiz: Rainbow Party](https://roytang.net/2024/06/popquiz-rainbow/): We attended Pop Quiz again at Int/Ext, this time with the Rainbow theme for Pride Month. They were away for a couple of months because the host had a health scare, but apparently we are back in business. Attendance: Me, C, S, Kim, Dan. This quiz night&#x27;s rounds were rainbow-themed, with one color per round (skipping Indigo). They&#x27;re mostly general knowledge questions except each themed around a color, so choosing a power-up round was a crapshoot. Here&#x27;s how we did: Red - 7pts Orange - 9pts x2 for successful ace. We got the ace answer at the very last question,

The other teams apparently weren&#x27;t used to quiz nights, so we kind of felt like bullies and there was a lot of good-natured trash-talking towards us. We won, but the final scores had the second place not as far away as everyone thought. Categories breakdown: General sitcom trivia: 12pts Sitcom theme music: 16pts Pinoy Sitcoms: 5pts Chandler&#x27;s punchlines: 10pts Sitcom sets: 10pts They had a quiz format where they actually prepared 8 categories but we only played 5. After the quiz, the

- [April 11, 2024, 11:28 p.m. Jason Quiz Night @ Don Conejos](https://roytang.net/2024/04/don-conejos-jason-quiz/): Jason, who used to host quiz nights at Amici Greenhills invited us to a quiz night at a new place: Don Conejos near Greenhills. The event was scheduled for 8pm and we were there on time, but it started late, almost 9:30pm I think. =/ We had a special guest from Sixsikan with us lol Jason&#x27;s quizzes always have &quot;misleading category names&quot; so you&#x27;re never sure what to use your joker on. This night&#x27;s categories were: &quot;Don&#x27;t You Forget About Me&quot; -&gt; Musician real names - 6pts &quot;Noong Unang Panahon&quot; -&gt; History - 8pts &quot;Play Ball&quot; -&gt; Sports - 2pts

- [March 24, 2024, 2:36 p.m. Popquiz: The Errors Tour](https://roytang.net/2024/03/popquiz-errors/): First popquiz for the year! This quiz was not entirely Taylor Swift-themed though that was a strong component. Alas, our Ace went poorly and with it our chance of winning the event. We ended up finishing 3rd out of 5 teams which wasn&#x27;t too bad (still got a prize!) Rounds were: Fearless Women in Pop Culture - 7? points, x0 because of failed Ace Cottagecore in Pop Culture - 4pts Paint the Town Red - 8pts Epic Fails and Faux Pas - 5pts References of Time - 5pts The Year 1989 - 8pts x2 for joker (Hail Mary): Name the
- [March 20, 2024, 8:39 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2024/03/112128055412962771/): I love RSS, but one thing I don&#x27;t like is that readers typically homogenize the appearance of posts from different sources, which is fine that&#x27;s how aggregators work. But I miss seeing the flair of individual websites so I often find myself clicking thru entries to see their site designs. I kind of want a stylesheet element in the RSS feeds and feed readers could have a toggle where you can view each feed&#x27;s entries with their custom styles. I understand how that could break things though.

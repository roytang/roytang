- [Oct. 10, 2023, 11:47 p.m. Movies: Tenet (2020)](https://roytang.net/2023/10/tenet-2020/): Enjoyed this one but it was a bit hard on the brain especially around the middle. Pretty good action and the plot mindbending to say the least. It wasn&#x27;t that bad if you don&#x27;t spend too much time trying to plot out all the timelines and puzzle over the loopholes but I suspect that plot was still way too complicated for the mass market audience and that Nolan lucked out with the pandemic happening as it did to lower box office expectations.

- [Sept. 1, 2025, 1:01 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/08/115124448145611956/): Last minute mythic on #MagicArena tonight. Had to give up on my pet omniscience decks and switch to Vivi Cauldron to get there, still took a while. I wish Arena had an emote that was like &quot;Please let me win, I just need 1 more to rank up!!&quot; Magic Arena screenshot of getting to Mythic rank

- [Aug. 27, 2025, 6:46 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/08/1n1dnix/): Posted on r/MagicArena: Midweek Magic: Pick-Two Draft doesn&#x27;t let you pick 2 of the same card. I had a pack with 2 Etali and trying to pick both of them just resulted in a network error and the pack reloaded and I had to choose again. I tried this again a second time later with some uncommon that was also doubled in a pack, same issue. I guess midweek magic is a good way to beta test this sort of thing.
- [Aug. 24, 2025, 5:16 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/08/115082986711650736/): Okay, I guess I&#x27;ll just ask: how do i post an html-formatted status using the mastodon api? Like using &lt;ul&gt;, &lt;blockquote&gt; and such. I&#x27;ve seen posts using such features (IDK if they came from non-Masto sources). I&#x27;ve tried putting the HTML in the `status` param (ref: https://docs.joinmastodon.org/methods/statuses/#create) but that doesn&#x27;t work apparently

- [Oct. 14, 2023, 12:18 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/10/111228610330972210/): Occasionally I&#x27;ll spot some spammy urls accessed on my server with chinese text and URLs related to buying backlinks. (Sample shown in screenshot - no alt-text because I don&#x27;t want to type out those spammy URLs) This is not a valid tag on my website. Why do they do this? What benefit does it get them? That text they send doesn&#x27;t appear on my website in any shape or form, and accessing these urls doesn&#x27;t change that! There are 200+ such hits on my access log for the current day!

- [Oct. 12, 2023, 11:28 p.m. Popquiz Magic Mystics](https://roytang.net/2023/10/popquiz-magic-mystics/): We hadn&#x27;t attended PopQuiz in a couple of months, but the categories for this one looked good so went for it. Attendance was low though, only 3 teams! Wizarding World / Harry Potter - 4pts Magic the Gathering - 9pts (x2 for joker. Hard carry!) Lord of the Rings - 8pts (x2 for successful ace) Game of Thrones - 6pts Discworld - 6pts (went surprisingly well considering I had only read 1/4 of the books Dungeons and Dragons - 6pts I was worried after round 1 because both of the opposing teams used their jokers and did well while it

- [Dec. 5, 2023, 5:07 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/12/111527017079592659/): It&#x27;s that time of the year again when companies pretend December isn&#x27;t part of the year, so here&#x27;s #Duolingo365 (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Dec. 2, 2023, 11:50 p.m. Movies: Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/12/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-2023/): This was a fun ride, but I feel like too much of the movie is dedicated to the whole &quot;fighting Nazis&quot; side of Indy and could have used a bit more tomb-raiding and puzzle-solving.Fleabag&#x27;s character was ok, though I wish she and the kid got a bit more of a conclusion at the end of it all. Also, I found hilarious the canon explanation as to why Shia Lebouf is not in this film lol.That bit towards the end makes this one of the more fantastical Indy films, but not as much as Crystal Skull!
- [Dec. 2, 2023, 3:50 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/12/111509729930849977/): This year I had shifted most of my music listening to Youtube and also i hooked up my spotify account to our family&#x27;s Amazon Echo which my mom basically uses as a radio. As a result my #SpotifyWrapped this year is almost entirely OPM oldies. Will look into a separate account for the Echo lol (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Nov. 30, 2023, 11:53 p.m. Popquiz: End With A Bang](https://roytang.net/2023/11/popquiz-bang/): Final quiz night for the year! Rounds were: Westerns - 5pts TV series final seasons - 5pts (x2 for poor choice of powerup)* Videogame sounds - 3pts (this was so tough!) Post-apocalyptic movies - 7pts (x2 for successful Ace) New Year&#x27;s Eve in media - 6pts Death, Orgasm or Faking It - 4pts (Hail Mary) actors who have portrayed Andres Bonifacio - 1pt We had a couple of bad rounds (the TV one was harder than we expected!). The &quot;Hail Mary&quot; mechanic returned and we were eligible, but it was useless for us as we scored even worse. Winning team
- [Nov. 23, 2023, 5:34 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/11/kaf5a9k/): Has anyone here tried applying for PCSO financial assistance via their NCR Online Application page? We were referred to this program to get additional financial support for some medical concerns, but IDK if the site is working properly, the URL is: https://www.pcso.gov.ph/webapps/NCROnlineApplication.aspx If I try to &quot;Proceed Online Application&quot; after midnight and before 8am, it just returns a message that says the website is only open Monday to Friday, 8am to 3pm. If I try it any time from 8am onwards, it just shows a message &quot;Please be informed that a daily budget cut-off is set for online applications. In

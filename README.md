- [Nov. 26, 2025, 11:39 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/11/nqtmfcf/): Oh wow, i would love to win this giveaway because i need to add a drive to my desktop so i can set up linux dual boot! Ive been wanting to slowly transition away from windows since all the ai shenanigans but i need more space to do so plus my secondary hdd (a 2tb seagate barracuda sshd) is already like 7yo at this point so i am worried it start having problems soon
- [Nov. 21, 2025, 10:35 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/11/115585354864950684/): @jessamyn this thread was great! id love to have this sort of job where i just help people out with tech issues all day (i basically already do it for my parents!). Sadly public libraries arent really a thing where I am :(

- [Oct. 25, 2025, 5:01 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/10/nla4a0f/): Google takeout should allow you to export your hangouts/chats, i believe in json format with attachments. I did this a few years ago but my custom parser is already lost to time

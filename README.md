- [Jan. 13, 2024, 4:21 p.m. Movies: Furious 7 (2015)](https://roytang.net/2024/01/furious-7-2015/): &quot;I think we went past ridiculous 3 or 4 movies ago.&quot; Sooo many over the top stunts! Still fun to watch, as long as you try not to make too much sense of everything. Feels like Dom accepting the whole God&#x27;s Eye plan was unnecessary, Shaw wasn&#x27;t hard to find, he kept coming at them. Deckard Shaw acts much more like a blunt instrument compared to his brother. I kind of assumed they would kill off Brian due to Paul Walker&#x27;s death, but apparently not? I suppose I&#x27;ll see what happens to him in the next film. His face looks
- [Jan. 11, 2024, 11:03 p.m. Movies: Fast &amp; Furious 6 (2013)](https://roytang.net/2024/01/fast-furious-6-2013/): Found this one a bit boring compared to the last one, at least until the final set of action set pieces at the end of the film. And ok, the tank reveal was fun. Still need to suspend a lot of disbelief! Tanks can&#x27;t go that fast! This can&#x27;t happen before Tokyo Drift, they still had flip phones there, this timeline makes no sense! And the weird height perspective scene between The Rock and Vin Diesel is here lol. I will admit to being entertained though, so maybe that&#x27;s enough.
- [Jan. 10, 2024, 7:31 a.m. Movies: Fast Five (2011)](https://roytang.net/2024/01/fast-five-2011/): The Rock has joined the franchise! I enjoyed the ensemble cast coming together (but how is Han alive?!? And that other person?!?) and the stunts and action set pieces were good as usual, though I suspect there are some laws of physics being violated in there somewhere. It helps my suspension of disbelief that I don&#x27;t know much about driving - but the film never takes itself too seriously anyway. I also liked the transition from a street racing focus to a heist focus, as I generally enjoy heist films more.
- [Jan. 6, 2024, 11:45 a.m. Movies: Fast &amp; Furious (2009)](https://roytang.net/2024/01/fast-furious-2009/): Action set pieces are still on point, but the plot here felt a bit contrived to be able to bring Dom and Brian on the same page, with a twist you could see coming. Oh and also not sure if I just wasn&#x27;t paying enough attention, but there was a part here about a fingerprint lookup that didn&#x27;t make sense?!?
- [Jan. 4, 2024, 10:25 p.m. Movies: The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)](https://roytang.net/2024/01/the-fast-and-the-furious-tokyo-drift-2006/): Glad to see the series tackle street racing culture outside of the US. Surprised to see a completely different lead in this one. Always happy to watch things set in Tokyo. That final race was intense, though it felt a bit silly that the audience was following through those tiny flip phones(I still don&#x27;t know anything about cars)

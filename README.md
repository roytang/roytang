- [Feb. 8, 2024, 11:17 p.m. Geekfight Hobby Stadium](https://roytang.net/2024/02/geekfight-hobby-stadium/): We attended Geekfight @ Hobby Stadium. Unfortunately, attendance was pretty low on this one, possibly due to the pre-long weekend traffic; the only other teams were a team of 2 and a team of 1, so it felt a bit like we were bullying them lol. We won this one. Hobby Stadium - 4pts (ROUND LEADER) MTG - 5pts x2 for joker (ROUND LEADER) WWE - 2pts Basketball - 4pts (ROUND LEADER) Pokemon - 1pts (tied for ROUND LEADER) Disney - 6pts (tied for ROUND LEADER) In addition to the usual winner prize, they gave away themed prizes for teams

Thinking of giving it another go. I only have Utopia and Apocalypse. If I could only get one of the other available DLCs, which one would be most interesting?

- [Jan. 24, 2024, 11:28 p.m. Geekfight League Final](https://roytang.net/2024/01/geekfight-league-final/): This was the final game of the Geekfight League &quot;season 1&quot;, with a &quot;Star Trek&quot; theme. Kelvin Timeline - 3pts (x2 for Joker) George Takei - 3pts Music - 3pts Bridge Crew - 4pts Science - 4pts Why is Star Trek - 6pts We did so terribly. We actually finished 4th out of 5 teams! However, our league points lead was insurmountable, so we still finished first in the league! Our prize for this was a replice of Stormbringer, Thor&#x27;s axe from Endgame, which I had to bring home, earning me a funny look from a taxi driver! Event Page
- [Jan. 17, 2024, 11:22 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2024/01/198ml84/): Posted on r/Philippines: I&#x27;m trying to remember an old Filipino movie from the 80s (or possibly early 90s) Baka may makatulong. I remember we watched it in the province; very rarely lang kami manood ng Filipino movie nuon. Some details I remember are: andun si Aiza may ninjas (?!?) or something similar meron isang scene na madilim sa gubat na may kalaban sila na &quot;alien&quot;/&quot;monster&quot;, but they used a Transformer toy to represent it. I remember this part kasi mahilig na ko sa Transformers toys nun so I recognized it (It was one of the G1 Predacons) The first two

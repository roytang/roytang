- [June 15, 2025, 1:02 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/06/114682791242906156/): I think I read something like if when you try some new thing and then you&#x27;re not immediately good at it and you find that annoying/disappointing/discouraging, that this is a sign of #ADHD or #Neurodivergence or something like that. How true is this?
- [June 13, 2025, 8:03 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/06/114675956063565364/): Will stream some more #FinalFantasy drafts on #MagicArena in a few minutes. Hopefully I do better than last time! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg

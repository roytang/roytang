- [Oct. 8, 2024, 11:48 p.m. TriviaDown: Video Games quiz night](https://roytang.net/2024/10/triviadown-videogames/): Trivia team attended a quiz night hosted by Trivia Down @ Skyline Sports Bar in Century City Mall in Makati. Last May attended one of their quizzes with a different group. This was the trivia team&#x27;s first foray with this host since before the pandemic. I usually dislike going all the way out to Makati, but we liked the theme for this one (videogames) and I was telling the group that pre-pandemic we used to go out to Makati quiz nights all the time, so maybe this was also a bit of an attempt to capture some of that energy.

FYI, your footnote links ([1], [2] and such) don&#x27;t work (the browser doesnt scroll to the appropriate footnote - no matching anchors). The backlinks from the footnotes do work though.

- [Aug. 14, 2024, 11:56 p.m. Popquiz Trivia Triathlon: Sports-themed Trivia Night](https://roytang.net/2024/08/popquiz-sports/): Attendance: Me, Cole, Liz+3 We attended another quiz night this week. I had low expectations for this one because sports! Only four teams attended. Rounds were: Boxing - 6pts Soccer - 6pts Basketball - 8pts Winter Sports - 5pts Olympics - 5pts Fictional Sports - 4pts (x2 for joker) (Hail Mary: Did not participate) ??? (Tie breaker: Did not affect us) Enumerate PH Olympic Medalists It turns out the rest of the teams had low expectations as well and we somehow still won despite no Hail Mary, no Ace, and using the joker power-up on our lowest-scoring round!

- [July 31, 2024, 11:51 p.m. Popquiz 8: The Power of Friendship](https://roytang.net/2024/07/popquiz-8-friendship/): We attended the Pop Quiz 8th anniversary quiz night at Int/Ext, themed around friendship. This was originally supposed to be scheduled last Wednesday and was a two-part event with the Deadpool and Wolverine screening I attended last week, but the quiz night had to be pushed due to weather problems. Attendance: Me, C, S, DJ+2. Seven main rounds this time, plus the Hail Mary. For their anniversary quiz, they have the &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; mechanic where for EVERY QUESTION the teams would vote to pick among four subcategories: People/Characters, Events, Places, or Things/Creatures. This meant the quiz ran much

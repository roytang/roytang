I had low expectations for this one because sports! Only four teams attended. Rounds were: Boxing - 6pts Soccer - 6pts Basketball - 8pts Winter Sports - 5pts Olympics - 5pts Fictional Sports - 4pts (x2 for joker) (Hail Mary: Did not participate) ??? (Tie breaker: Did not affect us) Enumerate PH Olympic Medalists It turns out the rest of the teams had low expectations as well and we somehow still won despite no Hail Mary, no Ace, and using the joker power-up on our lowest-scoring round!

- [July 31, 2024, 11:51 p.m. Popquiz 8: The Power of Friendship](https://roytang.net/2024/07/popquiz-8-friendship/): We attended the Pop Quiz 8th anniversary quiz night at Int/Ext, themed around friendship. This was originally supposed to be scheduled last Wednesday and was a two-part event with the Deadpool and Wolverine screening I attended last week, but the quiz night had to be pushed due to weather problems. Attendance: Me, C, S, DJ+2. Seven main rounds this time, plus the Hail Mary. For their anniversary quiz, they have the &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; mechanic where for EVERY QUESTION the teams would vote to pick among four subcategories: People/Characters, Events, Places, or Things/Creatures. This meant the quiz ran much

A bit last minute, but I wanted to get out of the house to do something enjoyable after an exhausting past few days, so I asked the team to go. This night&#x27;s categories and our scores were (I was unable to note all the misleading category names): movies with numbers in title - 10pts anatomy - 6pts &quot;The China Crisis&quot; -&gt; china - 9pts voice actors - 7pts &quot;Real Steel&quot; -&gt; superman - 5pts: even though I&#x27;m a comics guy, this round was a

- [July 7, 2024, 10:05 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2024/07/1dxhaua/): Posted on r/comicbooks: Iron Fist question Hi, I&#x27;m reading through Iron Fist stuff. In Iron Fist #73 (Oct 2017), Danny has Shou-Lao in a hidden dragon den in his condo building, feeding him cows. I don&#x27;t know how/why Shou-Lao got there?!? The last thing I remember is that at the end of Iron Fist: The Living Weapon #12 (May 2015), Pei brought back all 66 previous versions of Shou-Lao, and Luke and Danny say they&#x27;ll handle it, but I don&#x27;t think them handling the dragons was ever shown anywhere either?!?

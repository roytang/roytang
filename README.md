Latest notes:

- [Jan. 6, 2024, 11:45 a.m. Movies: Fast &amp; Furious (2009)](https://roytang.net/2024/01/fast-furious-2009/): Action set pieces are still on point, but the plot here felt a bit contrived to be able to bring Dom and Brian on the same page, with a twist you could see coming. Oh and also not sure if I just wasn&#x27;t paying enough attention, but there was a part here about a fingerprint lookup that didn&#x27;t make sense?!? (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Jan. 4, 2024, 10:25 p.m. Movies: The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)](https://roytang.net/2024/01/the-fast-and-the-furious-tokyo-drift-2006/): Glad to see the series tackle street racing culture outside of the US. Surprised to see a completely different lead in this one. Always happy to watch things set in Tokyo. That final race was intense, though it felt a bit silly that the audience was following through those tiny flip phones(I still don&#x27;t know anything about cars) (Click photos to view full-size)
- [Jan. 2, 2024, 11:57 p.m. Movies: 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)](https://roytang.net/2024/01/2-fast-2-furious-2003/): For some reason I found this more enjoyable than the first one, despite still knowing nothing about cars and racing. Maybe having a clear-cut villain was more interesting? Was also surprised at no Vin Diesel in this one, since it feels like the later films are all about him. LOLed at the cutting edge early-2000s cgi (Click photos to view full-size)

- [Dec. 31, 2023, 11:10 a.m. Movies: The Fast and the Furious (2001)](https://roytang.net/2023/12/the-fast-and-the-furious-2001/): Never seen any of this series, but the first four are up on NF, so I figured why not? I am not big on cars or racing so the plot did not particularly appeal to me, but some of the racing/chase scenes were intense. You could easily sense Paul Walker actually being a cop from the very beginning (mostly because his insistence on getting into Dom&#x27;s good graces and not caring about what happens to his car makes no sense).

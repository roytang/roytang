Latest notes:

- [Dec. 27, 2023, 4:54 a.m. Movies: The Creator (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/12/the-creator-2023/): Visually stunning and some excellent set pieces in there and I liked the portrayal of near-future Asia being oppressed by the US military because honestly that doesn&#x27;t seem too implausible. The sci-fi plot is more of an allegory for discrimination/acceptance than for our current &quot;AI&quot; landscape. Washington was fine, but that kid&#x27;s performance was superb.
- [Dec. 27, 2023, 4:51 a.m. Movies: They Cloned Tyrone (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/12/they-cloned-tyrone-2023/): This felt like a cross between &quot;Blaxploitation&quot; films and conspiracy comedies like Hot Fuzz. The former is not really my jam, but I liked the latter part of it. Kind of weird and the conspiracy involved felt over-the-top-ridiculous. Great performances by John Boyega (first time seeing him outside of Star Wars), Teyonnah Parris (first time seeing her outside of MCU) and Jamie Foxx.
- [Dec. 26, 2023, 10:56 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2023/12/111647299570441458/): Spent an hour and a half this morning putting together a new gaming chair. I didn&#x27;t ask for this, but must admit it feels good to sit in #gaming (Click photos to view full-size)

Latest notes:

- [Aug. 14, 2025, 1 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/08/n8hxwde/): How would it work with multiple devices? Does each device get its own keypair? But that means you would still need a traditional password as well, in order to do the initial auth and keypair generation on a new device? Also, if your device is compromised or your phone is lost, doesnt that mean someone else will now have access to all your accounts that had passkeys stored on that device, without needing a passwors?
- [Aug. 12, 2025, 9:03 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/08/115013098310132945/): @jefklak thank you for the kind words
- [Aug. 10, 2025, midnight ](https://roytang.net/2025/08/n7slqms/): Carey Mulligan &lt;3
- [Aug. 7, 2025, 4:25 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/08/114986524818022131/): @czeins no because the internet was genuinely useful for the most part. People didnt have to be hyped into using it
- [Aug. 7, 2025, 3:46 p.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/08/n7dnuvi/): The one you read should be Ultimate Spider-Man (2000-2009) ending in #133 After that you can look at (in order): Ultimatum: Spider-Man Requiem #1-2 Ultimate Spider-Man (2009-2012) #1-#15 and #150-#160 Ultimate Comics Spider-Man (2011-2013) #1-#28

- [Oct. 18, 2025, 7:22 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/10/115392076433200540/): Me: Time to play this well-reviewed 100-hour long turn-based JRPG from last year I&#x27;ve been looking forward to! *New indie roguelite released where you bounce a lot of balls around* Me: Welp #gaming [07:22] (Gonna try to play them both lol)
- [Oct. 10, 2025, 9:08 a.m. ](https://roytang.net/2025/10/nip2bbm/): Looks like the caracal already had 4 damage. When he moves the equipment to something else, the caracal became a 3/3 with 4 damage on it, so it dies.
